Asynchronous Javascript templating for the browser and server. This fork is maintained by [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.github.io/).

## Install

### NPM

**Important**: We recommend that you lock your version of Dust to a specific minor version, instead of a major version. By default, NPM will add `"dustjs-linkedin": "^2.x.y"` to your package.json, which will install new minor versions automatically.

    npm install --save --production dustjs-linkedin-fixed
    # If you want the dustc compiler available globally
    npm install --global --production dustjs-linkedin-fixed

If you want to add the [Dust helpers](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs-helpers) or [secure filters](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs-filters-secure):

    npm install --save --production dustjs-helpers
    npm install --save --production dustjs-filters-secure
